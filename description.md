This application analyzes the historical futures prices of Brent Crude Oil using the CHRIS/CME\_BZ1 dataset. The data covers a series of non-adjusted prices, based on spot-month continuous contract calculations. The raw data was originally obtained from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

The `CHRIS/CME_BZ1` represents:

*   `CHRIS` : The database name on Quandl, in this case, Wiki Continuous Futures.
*   `CME_BZ1` : The specific dataset code within the database, where:
    *   `CME` : Indicates the data source, Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
    *   `BZ1` : Stands for Brent Crude Oil Financial Futures, Continuous Contract #1.

Understanding the Codes:

*   `Brent Crude Oil` : A major trading classification of sweet light crude oil that serves as a major benchmark price for purchases of oil worldwide.
*   `Financial Futures` : A legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity (Brent Crude oil, in this case) at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future.
*   `Continuous Contract #1 (BZ1)` : The front month contract (the futures contract with the closest expiration date) at any given point in time.
*   `Non-adjusted price` : The presented data is 'raw', i.e., not adjusted for factors like dividends, stock splits, or changing contract sizes.

For more in-depth analysis and information, the dataset is available through [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/data/CHRIS/CME_BZ1).
